- name: Optimisation of 2 Chemical Processes for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) (Completed)
  description: A year-long research project to optimise the synthetic and recovery processes for two precious APIs. The combined effect of these projects exceeds 230,000 litres of chlorinated solvents in savings for the company. This project was conducted as part of my placement year at <a href="https://veranova.com/">Veranova</a> (previously <a href="https://matthey.com/">Johnson Matthey</a> Health, also known as MacFarlan Smith), a pharmaceutical company specialising in Controlled Drug (CD) manufacturing in the UK.
