  title: "I got my 5th Edinburgh Award!"
  description: "What an honour it is to receive my Edinburgh Award (Leadership in Student Opportunities) at the Play Fair Library at the University of Edinburgh! The award is a recognition of the skills I have developed as a Peer Support Student Coordinator over the past year. For the completion of this award, I chose to build on my leadership, project management and problem-solving skills. The award also encouraged me to make a positive, sustainable impact on my community, which led me to conduct projects such as: 
- Setting up a new peer support scheme, ChemPALS, within the School of Chemistry (https://lnkd.in/etxzFesg)
- Organising site visits to 3 chemical companies for 40 students.
Really loved and enjoyed my year in this role and I cannot thank my wonderful, fabulous, one-and-only line manager Jean O'Donoghue enough for her constant support throughout this journey!"
